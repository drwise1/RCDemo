RC Demos are presented

1.Using the exe files in "Executable files for VTM-5.0 RC(prop)", you can obtain the following files as the results of encoding: Ex) BasketballDrill sequence : you wil have a "log_BD_Q37_100_FRM_VTM_AI_RC_ON_P_lvl.txt" file. 
In order to execute the encoding, you need to execute the batch file(.bat) e.g. "encode_BD_RC_AI.bat". Default QP setting is 37. You can change some parameters for your experiment.

2.It is noticed that YUV files (video source) needed to encode the VTM-5.0 are not included in this folder.
